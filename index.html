    <p id="mainphotop">Hello! My name is Charles McCampbell-Hill and I am currently a student at Florida Gulf Coast
        University. I am passionate in all that I do but more specifically I am passionate about both computers and the
        joys that they can produce. In my free time I enjoy playing videogames, and through the years I have become
        somewhat of a critic.</p>
    <h1 id="anothertitle">About Me</h1>
    <p id="moreaboutmep">I am currently a junior at Florida Gulf Coast University with a major in Software Engineering.
        I am passionate about creating a pleasurable experience with users and creating something that will positively
        impact the world. Current experience with software include completion of multiple MITEdX courses, attendance at
        the 2019 Hertz Hackathon, and coding courses as FGCU. In the future I can see myself owning my own tech company
        that is dedicated to satisfying their users without robbing them of joy. Some examples of my work will be listed
        below. </p>
    <p id="bottlegamep"> This is a game I created while reading the book "Headfirst Java". The code created allows 3
        NPCs(Non Playing Characters) to have a chance at guessing a random number 0-9. Using loops, the game runs until
        one player has successfully guessed the correct number. If not, the game will run forever. I love taking
        screenshots of successful project to mark accomplishment points in my career. This one is especially important
        to me in that it was the first project that pushed me to switch to a software engineering major. Upon
        completion, I was still a mere marketing major, but something about the idea of being able to make cool things
        like this for a living caused me to switch. </p>
