    <h1>An Internet For All</h1>
    <p class="secondaryheading">Us here working at McCampbell-Hillsoft have a mission to make an internet that is friendly for users of all types.
        Certain steps are needed to create a beautiful yet functional website. Good HTML structure creates a beautiful website that
        is easy to navigate and allows users to enjoy a more in-depth experience.
        Ensuring a certain level of contrast between text and elements
        allows text to be easier to read for everyone. Avoiding style errors creates a clean visual experience for users and will make
        users feel comfortable when using your site.
    </p>
    <p class="secondaryheading">
        We also believe it is our duty to protect all users that visit our site. We encrypt all of the information given to
        us by a user. Use the button below to view an example of encryption.
    </p>
    <!--The following button takes an input from a prompt and converts it into ascii code, encrypting the users name-->
    <button onclick="cipher()">Encrypt my name</button>
    <script>
        function cipher() {
            var name = prompt("Enter your name");
            var ciphered = name.charCodeAt(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) + 3;
            alert(ciphered);

        }
