        <h1>An Internet For All</h1>
        <p>Us here working at McCampbell-Hillsoft have a mission to make an internet that is friendly for users of all types. 
            Certain steps are needed to create a beautiful yet functional website. Good HTML structure creates a beautiful website that
            is easy to navigate and allows users to enjoy a more in-depth experience.
            Ensuring a certain level of contrast between text and elements
            allows text to be easier to read for everyone. Avoiding style errors creates a clean visual experience for users and will make 
            users feel comfortable when using your site.
